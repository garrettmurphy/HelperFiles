# HelperFiles
These are just helpful files that I used in my day-to-day coding work...nothing special

##~/.bash_profile`
Don't forget to run `source ~/.bash_profile` after adding or editing this file

##`~/.git-completion.sh` 
referenced in .bash_profile, enables all kinds of awesomeness in Git

##`~/.gitconfig`
Replace < text > as appropriate
